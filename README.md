# LEAD Design Clothes

AI-powered apparel mockup studio to design, customize, and export garment previews from the browser.

## Overview

LEAD Design Clothes is a full-stack web experience for creating apparel mockups with AI-assisted workflows. It combines a canvas editor, garment catalog, front/back design support, layer management, and export features in one product.

Target users include independent designers, print-on-demand stores, and apparel teams that need fast visual prototypes without external design software.

## Main Features

### Editor and Workflow
- Canvas-based editing with drag, resize, rotate, duplicate, and delete actions
- Independent front and back composition per garment
- Printable-area guidance for safer placement
- Final review screen before export

### Creative Tools
- Upload image/logo assets and place them on canvas
- Text tool with typography controls
- Layers panel for ordering, visibility, and locking
- Garment color switching

### AI Features
- Browser-side background removal using `@imgly/background-removal`
- Prompt-to-image generation through `/api/ai-generate`
- Enhanced prompt generation via OpenRouter before image URL creation

### Export
- PNG export for front, back, or both sides
- Export modal integrated into review flow

## Routes

- `/` -> landing page
- `/studio` -> garment catalog/dashboard
- `/studio/[garmentId]` -> editor studio
- `/studio/[garmentId]/review` -> final review and export
